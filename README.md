=======

Final graded unit for HND in Interactive Media (web development). Lidiflu is an e-commerce site selling windmill parts
to the renewable energies industry.  The site allows people to login, purchase goods by adding to a cart, then checking 
out and paying for it using the Paypal API.</br>

The site is to showcase different principles and techniques I learnt during my study period and includes.</br>
<ul>
<li>OOP - User, Cart, Product, Product Line objects are used within the site.</li>
<li>APIs (web services) - Paypal Sandbox API is used to allow users to purchase items from the site.  Yahoo weather API is used
to determine wind speed in a specific area.  If its windy enough an advertising banner is displayed.</li>
<li>JQuery - Used for sliding banners</li>
<li>CSS3 animation - animated ticker display using CSS3 animatio shows windspeed in area</li>
<li>ORM - Objects are mapped to relational database</li>
<li>SQL - SQL database used to store user, product and order information.</li>
<li>AJAX - Partial page updates allow submission of adding to cart without whole page refresh</li>
</ul>
