LidiFlu
=======

Final graded unit for HND in Interactive Media (web development). Lidiflu is an e-commerce site selling windmill parts
to the renewable energies industry.  The site allows people to login, purchase goods by adding to a cart, then checking 
out and paying for it using the Paypal API.

The site is to showcase different principles and techniques I learnt during my study period and includes.

OOP - User, Cart, Product, Product Line objects are used within the site.
APIs (web services) - Paypal Sandbox API is used to allow users to purchase items from the site.  Yahoo weather API is used
to determine wind speed in a specific area.  If its windy enough an advertising banner is displayed.
JQuery - Used for sliding banners
CSS3 animation - animated ticker display using CSS3 animatio shows windspeed in area
ORM - Objects are mapped to relational database
SQL - SQL database used to store user, product and order information. 
AJAX - Partial page updates allow submission of adding to cart without whole page refresh
